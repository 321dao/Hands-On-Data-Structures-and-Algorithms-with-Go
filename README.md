## Subtitle: 
Level up Your Core Programming Skills to develop faster and efficient code

## Target Audience 
This book is for developers who would like to learn the Data Structures and Algorithms in Golang. Basic Go programming knowledge would be an added advantage.

## Short Description
Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Go covers topics related to simple, advanced and complex concepts in computer programming. The primary objective is to choose a right algorithm and data structures for a problem. This book provides the concepts to compare algorithms complexity and data structures for code performance and efficiency.

## Long Description
Golang has been the buzzword for the last 2 years with tremendous improvements being done in the language. Many developers and organizations are slowly migrating to Golang, adopting its fast, lightweight and inbuilt concurrency features. This brings the need to have a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms with this growing language.

This book is for one who wants to learn how to write efficient programs and use the proper data structures and algorithm. It will be your companion as it takes you through implementing classic data structures and algorithms in Go, helping you to become a confident Go programmer. You will begin by understanding the basic Data types and Structures in Go. Moving ahead, you will learn the power of linked lists and doubly linked lists in Go. You will then learn to implement the linear data structures such as Stacks and Queues followed by Binary searches, Trees, exploring sorting algorithms and further about Graph algorithms. You will also be introduced to some common data structures used while working with strings followed by the common techniques and structures used in tasks such as preprocessing, modeling and transforming data. Moving a step forward, this book will also teach you how to apply traditional data structures to solve real-world problems.

## Key Features
Understand common data structures and algorithms, as well as the context in which they are used
Use data structures such as arrays, stacks, trees, lists and graphs with real-world examples
Learn the functional and reactive implementations of the traditional data structures

## What you will learn?
See how to improve the application performance using right data structure and algorithm in web and mobile applications.
Will be able to understand how an algorithm solves the problem and right data structure is chosen for a problem.
Enumerate solutions to a problem and identify algorithms and data structures after doing the trade-off analysis of costs and benefits.
Get a grasp on techniques to write pseudo code for an algorithm and ace in white boarding or interviewing situations.
Discover the pitfalls in selecting data structures and algorithms by predicting how fast and efficient is an algorithm or a data structure.

## Metadescription
Explore Golang’s Data Structures and Algorithms that will help you Design, Implement, and Analyze Code in Practical/Professional setting.
